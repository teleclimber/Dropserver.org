        <h1>DropServer</h1>

        <h2>An Application Platform for Your Own Web-Based Services</h2>

        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>DropServer is an open source platform for hosting a multitude of small web-based applications.</p>

        <p>Unlike typical application platforms that are designed to host one application for many users, DropServer is designed to host many different applications just for you.</p>

        <p>Instead of being a developer tool, it is a user-centered system with the ability to install and use server-side applications from a graphical interface.</p>

        <p>DropServer is a kindred spirit of the IndieWeb movement, which aims to give internet user the means to control their presence on the web. DropServer's goal is for users to control the code that runs on servers.</p>
        
        <h3>Your Own Cloud Applications</h3>
        <p>Instead of signing up for services that eventually shutdown, degrade, or pivot away, set up a dropserver and install your own applications.</p>

        <p>With DropServer, installing an applictiaon takes a few clicks (zero command line necessary), and you can tell it to upgrade itself automatically or manually control when to upgrade.</p>

        <h3>Convenient Cloud</h3>
        <p>No need to create a new login for each application you install. DropServer gives you single-sign-on to all your installed applications.</p>

        <p>Even better: use the DropServer contacts list to invite others to your multi-user application. They too will be able to log in to your application using their existing DropServer account.</p>

        <h3>Sandboxed Cloud Applications</h3>
        <p>Each application runs in a sandbox that prevents it from reading files from disk or contacting any server on the internet by default. If it needs to do any such thing that permission must be explicitly granted by the user.</p>

        <h3>Portable Cloud</h3>
        <p>Pick up and move from one DropServer to another. Applications and associated data can be exported and moved to a new home, giving you the freedom to relocate whenever you feel like it.</p>

        <h3>Efficient Cloud</h3>
        <p>How many apps do you have on your phone? How many do you use regularly? Dropserver is designed with that usage pattern in mind: users should be able to install many applications yet only the actively used ones should consume resources like RAM or CPU cycles.</p>

        <p>My goal is that DropServer should be able to serve dozens of applications from a low power device like a Raspberry Pi.</p>
