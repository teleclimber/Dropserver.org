# Using ds-dev to Develop Dropserver Applications

`ds-dev` is a command line tool that runs Dropserver applications locally for the purpose of developing apps.

Some features and capabilities:

- Serves apps at `localhost` over plain `HTTP` (no need to set up TLS) so you can just fire it up and get going.
- It can emulate any user of the appspace or a non-authenticated user, making it easy to test your app as a logged in user or as a member of the public.
- You can point it to an existing appspace data directory (like a backup you downloaded from `ds-host`) to test your app changes on actual "production" data.
- `ds-dev` watches your application files and re-reads your app's metadata after each save.
- The UI shows your app's metadata like routes and schemas.
- The UI has live views of logs, route hits, status, etc...
- Manually run migrations to test your migration code
- Set "Inspect" mode to debug your app code as it runs in the sandbox.
- [Create an app package](app-packaging-distributing)

<Note>There is a video demonstrating `ds-dev` in the [tutorial](/docs/build-dropserver-app-tutorial/).</Note>

## Installing ds-dev

Get the `ds-dev` executable from the [Dropserver releases](https://github.com/teleclimber/Dropserver/releases) page. The packaged executable is available for MacOS or Linux. Windows users should use the Linux version under WSL2.

<Note>Dropserver uses Deno as its sandbox, therefore `ds-dev` requires [Deno](https://deno.land) to be installed and available on the path.</Note>

## Running A Dropserver App in ds-dev

To run an app you are developing in `ds-dev` you point it to the directory of the app's source:

```
$ ds-dev -app=/path/to/app/dir/
```

Refer to the [tutorial](/docs/build-dropserver-app-tutorial/) to learn what goes in the "app" directory.

<Note>Once `ds-dev` has started, you can leave it running while you work on your app code. It will reload the app when you save.</Note>

To provide an existing appspace as working data:

```
$ ds-dev -app=/path/to/app/dir/ -appspace=/path/to/appspace/files/
```

If you downloaded appspace data from `ds-host` you must unzip it before pointing `ds-dev` to it.

<Note>The appspace data is never modified. `ds-dev` copies all the files from the provided directory into a temporary directory, and uses that as the working data.</Note>


#### Run a packaged app

You can also run a packaged app in `ds-dev`. This can be handy if you want to take a quick look at an app that has already been packaged, or if you'd like to test a new version of an app locally:

```
$ ds-dev -app=/path/to/mysuperapp-1.2.3.tar.gz
```

## ds-dev UI Basics

Once running `ds-dev` should indicate that its UI is available at `http://localhost:3003/dropserver-dev/`. Make sure this port is available prior to running `ds-dev`.

Open `http://localhost:3003/dropserver-dev/` in a browser window. The UI should show you basic data about your app, and appspace if there is any.

If the app was loaded without errors and no migration is needed for the appspace data, then you should be able to visit `http://localhost:3003/` to access your app's "/" page.

### App Tab

The "App" tab shows you data that `ds-dev` collected about your app. In particular the name, version, schema and migrations available, along with a table of app routes.

![ds-dev app tab user interface](/docs/ds-dev/app.png)

If `ds-dev` encountered an error while trying to read this data it will report it at the top of this panel. Clicking "Expand" reveals the app log, which will help you figure out where the problem is.

### Appspace Tab

The "Appspace" tab is mostly concerned with the data of this appspace (remember that an "app" is just code and an "appspace" is essentially a data directory for an instance of the app. See [application model page](/docs/application-model).)

![ds-dev appspace tab](/docs/ds-dev/appspace.png)

The buttons at the top of this panel include:

* **Pause**: "pausing an appspace" in Dropserver means blocking all access to it. All routes return "503: Service Unavailable".
* **Reload Appspace**: in `ds-dev` the app code operates on a copy of the provided appspace data. This button erases the working copy and re-copies the data then automatically runs migrations if any are needed. This is handy when some code you're working on doesn't quite work right and has corrupted your data.
* **Migrate**: Manually run migration steps. Use this for testing migrations.

At the bottom of this tab, as well as the "Users" and "Route Hits" tabs lives the appspace log. All console log statements as well as some internal messages related to the appspace are reported there.

### Users Tab

Displays users and lets you select a user to emulate. 

![ds-dev users tab](/docs/ds-dev/users.png)

If you loaded an existing appspace, the users in that appspace will show up there.

<Note>Users are considered appspace data. Therefore when you "Reload Appspace" in the "Appspace" tab, you reset the list of users.</Note>

Click on the radio button to select a user to emulate. Click "Log Out" to emulate no user (your requests are unauthenticated).

### Route Hits Tab

Requests made towards your appspace show up under "Route Hits".

![ds-dev route hits tab](/docs/ds-dev/route-hits.png)

Each "hit" tells you what was requested (authentication if any, method, path) and the response code on the first line.

On the second line information about the matched route is shown: the authentication requirements, the route path, and the resulting action (serve static files or run function handler in sandbox).

### Sandbox Control Widget

In addition to the four tabs we just outlined, an important feature is the sandbox control widget at the top of the `ds-dev` interface.

![ds-dev sandbox control widget](/docs/ds-dev/sandbox-control.png)

You will see the status of the sandbox change as the system reloads app metadata, runs migrations, and executes route handlers.

Click the "Inspect" button to inspect running code. The process is as follows:

- Click "Inspect" button to tell `ds-dev` you wish for it to run the Deno sandbox with `--inspect-brk`
- If a sandbox is already running, it will stop.
- Do something to trigger the sandbox to start:
  - To inspect app processing (if you got an error in the "App" tab for example) save a file in your app directory to trigger the reload.
  - To inspect migration code, manually trigger a migration in the "Appspace" tab.
  - To inspect a route handler, load that route in your browser.
- The sandbox will enter "starting sandbox" status, and wait.
- Open the Chrome browser at `chrome://inspect" and click on the Deno instance (or use another compatible debugger).
- Open files, set breakpoints, and resume execution to let the sandbox finish starting.
- When you are done click "Inspect" again.

## Create an App Package

To create a package that can be installed on `ds-host` from the app files run the following command:

```
$ ds-dev -app=/path/to/app/dir/ -create-package=/path/to/output/dir -package-name=my-super-app
```

`-package-name` is optional but highly recommended. Generated file names will start with "my-super-app" and will include the version specified in the manifest: `my-super-app-1.2.3.tar.gz` and `my-super-app-1.2.3.json`, etc...

`-create-package` generates the following files:

- the actual `.tar.gz` package file which can be installed on `ds-host`.
- a `.json` manifest file that includes metadata extracted by running the app before packaging.
- an icon file, copied from the application icon specified in the manifest. The saved filename consists of a hash of the contents of the file.
- a `.txt` file that contains the changelog for the current version only.

The package file can be installed manually on a Dropserver instance. The last three files are used when creating the distribution site.

## Create an App Distribution Site

To create app distribution website files, run this command:

```
$ ds-dev -create-listing=/path/to/packages/dir/
```

Where `/path/to/packages/dir/` is the directory where you generated the package files.

Optional arguments are:

- `-base-url` sets the base URL in the app listing. This is normally not necessary.
- `-html-template` is the path to a [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) template to use instead of the default. The original template is in the [Dropserver repository](https://github.com/teleclimber/Dropserver) at `/cmd/ds-dev/distsite/index.html`.

This command will generate `app-listing.json` alongside the package files. It contains a list of versions and the filenames for the package, manifest, changelog, and app icon. It also generates an HTML file that presents your application to a potential visitor, along with installation instructions.

After uploading all the files in `/path/to/packages/dir/` to a static site server, any Dropserver user can install your app and keep it updated. See [App Packaging and Distribution](/docs/app-packaging-distributing).
