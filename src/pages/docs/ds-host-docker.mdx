# Run Dropserver Locally Using Docker

Docker images configured to run `ds-host` are [available here](https://hub.docker.com/r/teleclimber/ds-host/tags). These images are designed to give you a way to try out Dropserver without going through the entire rather installation process.

However these images are not configurable, light on security, and can / should only be run locally.

<Warning>
NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE

Due to challenges of running containers within containers, this configuration of ds-host does not isolate each appspace in its own container. You are fully dependent on Deno for isolation.

Furthermore no cgroups are used to ensure one app doesn't use up all your CPU cycles.
</Warning>

These limitations are largely due to the difficulty of running containers within containers as well as using cgroups within Docker containers. For this reason the Dropserver project provides these images to enable potential Dropserver users to "kick the tires" without committing too much time.

# Instructions

The Docker images are available here: **[hub.docker.com/r/teleclimber/ds-host](https://hub.docker.com/r/teleclimber/ds-host/tags)**.

Assuming you have docker installed and running on your system, run this command:

```
docker run -p 5050:5050 teleclimber/ds-host:latest
```

You will then see in the log a line that includes the secret link to create your admin account:

```
[...] Use this link to create an administrator account: setup_key_reveal=http://dropid.local.dropserver.org:5050/12345678
```

Open the link in a browser, create an admin account and you're in.

# Map A Volume

If you wish to preserve your data map a volume to `/srv/dropserver`.

The docker image will automatically migrate your data if an upgrade calls for it.

# Further Caveats

As noted above this isn't intended for production use. It all runs on HTTP (no TLS) and there is no way to customize the domain name or other [configuration values](ds-host-config-ref) apart from going intot he container and modifying the config file.

# What Now?

Now that you have Dropserver running, have a look at how easy it is to make an app [here](build-dropserver-app-tutorial).
