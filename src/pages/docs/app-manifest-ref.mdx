# Dropserver Application Manifest

<ValidVersion from="0.12.0"></ValidVersion>

The Dropserver application manifest is a `JSON` file located at the root of package and always named `dropapp.json`.

The manifest represents data that pertains to a specific version of the app. Some of the data is different from version to version (such as the `version` value) while others may be the same (such as the application `name`).

Some parts of the manifest are written directly by the app developer, typically by manually editing `dropapp.json`, others are generated by the application packaging system.

### Manifest files and the installation flow

The application packaging system runs the app in a sandbox and acquires metadata about the app by querying the running app. This metadata is then combined with the data in `dropapp.json` to create a complete manifest that is included in the package (instead of the original `dropapp.json`).

When a user uploads a new app or new version of an app, the process is repeated: the system runs the app in a sandbox, and overwrites the metadata from the running app in the manifest. This ensures that tampering with the manifest values has no effect. 

## Manifest Reference

The following are keys of the manifest JSON object. All are optional except for `version`, though many are highly recommended for obvious reasons.

<Note>The manifest file must be in the root of the package and must be named `dropapp.json`.</Note>

`name`: The application name. Try to keep it under 30 characters.

`version`: **Required.** The [Semver 2.0](https://semver.org/) version of the app. For the time being please avoid including pre-release and build metadata in the version.

`entrypoint`: If the module that exports your app is not `app.ts` or `app.js`, you can specify the path (relative to the root of the package) to that module here.

`icon`: Relative path to application icon. Icon should be in the app package and should be `jpg`, `png`, `svg`, or `webp`. It should be square and at least 160 pixels in size. Please run your icon file through an optimizer program to keep the file size to a minimum!

`accent-color`: A CSS color to use to make the app stand out. Currently this color is applied to a thick border above the app box. Choose a bold color that marries with your icon colors. Assume the background is white or light grey, but do not worry about accessibility: the color is never used for text or as a background to text.

`short-description`: A short description for the application. Tell the user what this does for them in one short sentence. Try to keep in under 60 characters.

`changelog`: Relative path to a plain text file containing a human-readable description of changes in the current version. By default the system tries to read `/changelog.txt` in the package if nothing is specified here. The changelog follows [a specific format](app-packaging-distributing#changelog-file-format).

`authors`: An array of objects listing the authors of the app. Each author object consists of: `name`, `url`, and `email`. At times only the first few authors of the array will be shown, therefore these should be the main authors. 

`license`: The software license as a [SPDX](https://spdx.org/licenses/) string.

`license-file`: A path to the license file relative to the package root.

`website`: The URL of the website for the app. This could be a complete website, a single page, or a blog post introducing the app.

`code`: The URL of the app's code repository.

`funding`: The URL where the author(s) can accept donations. If there are several options for donating, consider making a page on the app or author site that lists these options.

## Automatically Generated Manifest Reference

These additional keys are automatically generated by the app packaging system:

`schema`: The integer version of the appspace data schema.

`migrations`: An array of migration functions that the app code provides.

`release-date`: The date in GMT is added by `ds-dev` at packaging time. It serves to tell the user how old or recent this release is.
