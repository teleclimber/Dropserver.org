# Packaging and Distributing Apps

<ValidVersion from="0.11.0"></ValidVersion>

Packaging your apps empower other users to install and run them on their own Dropserver instance with minimal effort. A package contains an archive of the application files and assets, and a manifest describing the app.

<Note>This page is a incomplete. App packaging was done in version 0.11, but more work is needed to make distribution and installation convenient.</Note>

## Create an App Package

Developers should follow the guidelines for [building an app](building-dropserver-app).

Note that the backend code might import code from `deno.land/x` and possibly other sources. This is acceptable. The `ds-host` instance will fetch and cache these dependencies as necessary. 

### Package The App

Make sure all built assets get built before running the app packaging tool.

To actually create an app package you must have [`ds-dev`](ds-dev) installed. Run the following command:

```
ds-dev -app=/path/to/app -create-package=/path/to/dist -package-name=my-super-app
```  

Note that the app directory is not necessarily the root of your code repository. See the section on directory structure in [building and app](building-dropserver-app).

The directory passed to `-create-package` is where the package file and manifest will be written.

The `-package-name` is the base file name of the package. `ds-dev` will append the version (as specified in the manifest) and the tar.gz extension. In this case: `my-super-app-0.1.0.tar.gz`.

`ds-dev` will also output a complete manifest alongside the package with extension `.json`. This is a convenience and will be used in the future as part of the distribution mechanism.

### Use Your Packaged App

Once a package is created you can use it via `ds-dev`:

```
ds-dev -app=my-super-app-0.1.0.tar.gz
```

You can also upload it to your `ds-host` instance via the user interface. If you don't have a ds-host instance, you can spin one up temporarily via [Docker](ds-host-docker).
