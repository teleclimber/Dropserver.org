# Packaging and Distributing Apps

<ValidVersion from="0.12.0"></ValidVersion>

Packaging your apps empower other users to install and run them on their own Dropserver instance with minimal effort. A package contains an archive of the application files and assets, and a manifest describing the app.

<Note>This page is a incomplete. App packaging was done in version 0.11, but more work is needed to make distribution and installation convenient.</Note>

## Prepare Your App

While an app may run fine in `ds-dev` or even `ds-host`, it may need a little more polish before distributing it to a broader audience.

Developers should follow the guidelines for [building an app](building-dropserver-app).

Note that the backend code might import code from `deno.land/x` and possibly other sources. This is acceptable. The `ds-host` instance will fetch and cache these dependencies as necessary.

Some nice things to include in your app before packaging:

- short-description
- icon
- accent-color
- changelog
- license
- listing of authors, websites, etc...

See the [app manifest reference](app-manifest-ref) for specific details on each.

### Changelog file format

The changelog is a plain text file that describes changes in the app for the benefit of the end-user.

The changes for a given version are preceded by a line containing the version being described. This version must match exactly the version in the app manifest.

Multiple versions can be described in the changelog file, in any order. See example below:

```
0.1.1

Removed all the explosions. Sorry about that.

0.1.0

Major release! Explosive new features!

Multiple lines of explosive new features in this release!!

0.0.1

Initial release.
```

## Create an App Package

Make sure all built assets get built before running the app packaging tool.

To actually create an app package you must have [`ds-dev`](ds-dev) installed. Run the following command:

```
ds-dev -app=/path/to/app -create-package=/path/to/dist -package-name=my-super-app
```  

Note that the app directory is not necessarily the root of your code repository. See the section on directory structure in [building and app](building-dropserver-app).

The directory passed to `-create-package` is where the package file and manifest will be written.

The `-package-name` is the base file name of the package. `ds-dev` will append the version (as specified in the manifest) and the tar.gz extension. In this case: `my-super-app-0.1.0.tar.gz`.

`ds-dev` will also output a complete manifest alongside the package with extension `.json`. This is a convenience and will be used in the future as part of the distribution mechanism.

### Use Your Packaged App

Once a package is created you can use it via `ds-dev`:

```
ds-dev -app=my-super-app-0.1.0.tar.gz
```

You can also upload it to your `ds-host` instance via the user interface. If you don't have a ds-host instance, you can spin one up temporarily via [Docker](ds-host-docker).
