# Run your own Dropserver with ds-host

<ValidVersion from="0.10.0">Docs for older versions are [here](ds-host-0.9).</ValidVersion>

`ds-host` is the full Dropserver and is intended to serve your appspaces in use. `ds-host` serves a user interface for administrators and users, as well as requests destined for appspaces. (see [Application Model](application-model) for a better understanding of this concept.) It can listen on ports 80 and 443 or it can sit behind a reverse proxy (see below). `ds-host` is Linux-only and must be run on x86 architecture (for now).

<Note>`ds-host` is for running a full instance of Dropserver. If you just want to run an app locally for development purposes, use [`ds-dev`](ds-dev).</Note>

# Warning âš 

At this point a good chunk of `ds-host` is functional. You can upload app code, create appspaces, migrate, add users, and use the appspace with other users.

However:

- There are going to be **security holes**. Don't use app code you don't trust. Don't put it up on the public internet unless it's completely isolated in a VM and don't put data on there you can't afford to have stolen
- There are some memory and goroutine leaks
- Some functionality is missing or half-baked
- APIs that the apps use are going to change a few times before they become stable
- The config file schema may change too

# Install ds-host 

Obtain the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/teleclimber/Dropserver/releases) page and unzip. Place in `/usr/local/bin` or some other directory of your choice.

### Install Dependencies

You should have [Deno](https://deno.land) installed and available from wherever you'll be running `ds-host`.

[Bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) is optional but recommended. It is used to wrap Deno in an additional sandbox based on Linux namespaces. Should a vulnerability be discovered in Deno, Bubblewrap should prevent an exploit from causing any harm. Of course an attacker will try to also find an exploit to get out of the Bubblewrap sandbox too, but two exploits are harder to find than one.

<Note>The way `ds-host` uses `bwrap` currently is preliminary and not ideal. Further improvements to sandbox security can be expected down the road.</Note>

Bubblewrap is available from package managers of most distros. `ds-host` should work with `bwrap` version 0.5 or higher.

If you do not wish to use Bubblewrap set `sandbox.use-bubblewrap` to `false` in your config file. See below for more details.

### Domain Name

Dropserver makes use of subdomains to separate appspaces and the user administration site into different origins. For this reason you need to forward a domain and all its subdomains to your instance.

One way to do this is by setting A and AAAA records for `@` and `*` (wildcard) to your instance IP.

### Create Directories

Create an empty data directory, let's say it is `/srv/dropserver`.

Create and empty directory for sockets, say `/var/run/dropserver`.

Make sure the user that will be running `ds-host` has read, write and execute permissions for these directories.

# Configuration File

Create a configuration file such as `/etc/dropserver.json` and make sure the user running `ds-host` can read it.

Read below for configuration examples, and consult the [configuration variables](ds-host-config-ref) reference for more details.

### With TLS Termination

If you wish expose `ds-host` directly to the internet this configuration will work:

```json
{
	"data-dir": "/srv/dropserver",
	"server": {
		"tls-port": 443,
		"http-port": 80
	},
	"external-access": {
		"subdomain": "dropid",
		"domain": "example.com"
	},
	"manage-certificates": {
		"enable": true,
		"acme-account-email": "you@example.com"
	},
	"sandbox":{
		"sockets-dir": "/var/run/dropserver",
		"use-bubblewrap": false,
		"use-cgroups": false
	}
}
```

In this case `ds-host` will use Let's Encrypt to generate certificates for each subdomain as needed, starting with `dropid.example.com`.

<Note>Currently `ds-host` does not serve anything when loading the naked domain (example.com). To log in you will visit dropid.example.com (replacing example.com with your domain naturally).</Note>

### Behind Reverse Proxy

If you are running `ds-host` behind a reverse proxy listening on ports 80 and 443 with SSL termination (recommended) your config might look something like this:

```json
{
	"data-dir": "/srv/dropserver",
	"server": {
		"http-port": 5050,
		"no-tls": true
	},
	"external-access": {
		"subdomain": "dropid",
		"domain": "example.com"
	},
	"sandbox":{
		"sockets-dir": "/var/run/dropserver",
		"use-bubblewrap": false,
		"use-cgroups": false
	}
}
```

In this case you can not use certificate management on ds-host. In this case it is best to obtain a wildcard certificate for the domain and configure your reverse proxy to use that.

### Local Network

If you are experimenting on a local network and you are using non-standard ports, you might try a configuration like this one:

```json
{
	"data-dir": "/srv/dropserver",
	"server": {
		"tls-port": 5050,
		"ssl-cert": "/path/to/ssl/example_com.crt",
		"ssl-key": "/path/to/ssl/example_com.key"
	},
	"external-access": {
		"domain": "example.com",
		"subdomain": "dropid",
		"port": 5050
	},
	"sandbox":{
		"sockets-dir": "/var/run/dropserver",
		"use-bubblewrap": false,
		"use-cgroups": false
	}
}
```

With this configuration the site will be reachable at https://dropid.example.com:5050 (set your local DNS server accordingly). There would be no reverse proxy in this scenario, and `ds-host` does the SSL termination.

### No TLS

You can also skip the whole TLS thing for local experimentation like this:

```json
{
	"data-dir": "/srv/dropserver",
	"server": {
		"http-port": 5050,
		"no-tls": true
	},
	"external-access": {
		"scheme": "http",
		"domain": "example.com",
		"subdomain": "dropid",
		"port": 5050
	},
	"sandbox":{
		"sockets-dir": "/var/run/dropserver",
		"use-bubblewrap": false,
		"use-cgroups": false
	}
}
```

### Bubblewrap

In the examples above we turned Bubblewrap off for the sake of simplicity. If you have Bublewrap (typically easily installed via your package manager) then you need to make a few changes to your config:

```json
{
	...
	"sandbox": {
		"use-bubblewrap": true,
		"bwrap-map-paths": ["..."]
	}
}
```

The `bwrap-map-paths` is the tricky bit. These are the paths from the host that must be mapped to the sandbox such that Deno can work. For Ubuntu, the following seems to work:

```json
"bwrap-map-paths": ["/lib", "/usr/lib", "/etc", "/lib64", "/run"]
```

For Arch, this works (and is the default value):

```json
"bwrap-map-paths": ["/usr/lib", "/etc", "/lib64"]
```

### CGroups

Regardless of the configuration you use from above, you can add cgroup control of sandbox resource usage.

By default `ds-host` uses cgroups (version 2) to measure and control resources used by appspaces (this is a work in progress). 

<Note>To use cgroups, `ds-host` must run in a delegatable cgroup. This is typically accomplished by having systemd run ds-host as a service, and setting `Delegate=true` in the service config (see below).</Note>

The default config for cgroups looks like this:

```json
{
	...
	"sandbox": {
		...
		"use-cgroups": true,
		"cgroup-mount": "/sys/fs/cgroup",
		"memory-high-mb": 512
	}
}
```

- `use-cgroups` set to false if you can not or do not want to deal with cgroups.
- `cgroup-mount`: the location of your system's cgroups.
- `memory-high-mb`: the `memory.high` value for the cgroup that contains all the sandbox cgroups, in megabytes.

## Initial Run

Once you have a configuration file ready, initialize the DB. The `-migrate` flag will migrate the DB to the latest schema, creating a DB in the process if needed.

```
$ ds-host -config=/etc/dropserver.json -migrate
```

Finally, you can start `ds-host` directly:

```
$ ds-host -config=/etc/dropserver.json
```

<Note>The first time you run `ds-host` the system will detect that there is no admin user and it will create a secret link where you can register as an admin. The link is printed in the log output, which is also echoed to your terminal if you run `ds-host` as above. Look for `setup_key_reveal=` and use the link to create an account.</Note>

## Run with Systemd

In practice it's easier to have systemd run `ds-host`. This is particularly true if you have configured resource limits of appspace sandboxes using cgroups.

Here is a minimal unit file you can use to get started. Replace values as needed and save it alongside other systemd services (such as `/etc/systemd/system/dropserver.service` on Arch).

```
[Unit]
Description=Dropserver service
ConditionPathExists=/path/to/ds-host
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=dsuser
Group=dsuser
TimeoutStopSec=15

# This lets ds-host bind to a low port (80, 443) without running as root:
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE

Delegate=true

ExecStart=/path/to/ds-host -config=/etc/dropserver.json

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then you can start the service:

```
$ sudo systemctl start dropserver 
```

Check the service is running with:

```
$ systemctl status dropserver 
```

Tail the logs using:

```
$ journalctl -u dropserver.service -f
```

## Log In

Now that `ds-host` is running and you created your admin user, some of the first things to do will be:

- Create a dropid for yourself. A dropid is an id that can be a user of an appspace.
- Add an app by uploading it manually. I recommend you go through the [app tutorial](build-dropserver-app-tutorial) to understand what goes into making apps.
- Create an Appspace by choosing an app and a subdomain.

Now that you have Dropserver running, have a look at how easy it is to make an app [here](build-dropserver-app-tutorial).
