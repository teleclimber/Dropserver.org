# Run your own Dropserver with ds-host

<ValidVersion from="" to="0.8.x"></ValidVersion>

`ds-host` is the full Dropserver and is intended to serve your appspaces in use. `ds-host` serves a user interface for administrators and users, as well as requests destined for appspaces. (see [Application Model](application-model) for a better understanding of this concept.) It can listen on ports 80 and 443 or it can sit behind a reverse proxy (see below). `ds-host` is Linux only and must be run on x86 architecture (for now).

<Note>`ds-host` is for running a full instance of Dropserver. If you just want to run an app locally for development purposes, use [`ds-dev`](ds-dev).</Note>

# Warning âš âš âš 

At this point a good chunk of `ds-host` is functional. You can upload app code, create appspaces, migrate, add users, and use the appspace with other users.

However:

- There are going to be **security holes**. Don't use app code you don't trust. Don't put it up on the public internet unless it's completely isolated in a VM and don't put data on there you can't afford to have stolen.
- Leaks! Memory ðŸ“ˆ goroutines ðŸ“ˆ
- Lots of missing or half-baked functionality
- Some of the UI is un-styled, incomplete, or simply missing entirely
- No user docs
- APIs that the apps use are going to change a lot
- Config file schema will change too

# Install ds-host 

Obtain the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/teleclimber/Dropserver/releases) page and unzip. Place in `/usr/local/bin` or some other directory of your choice.

You should have [Deno](https://deno.land) installed and available from wherever you'll be running `ds-host.

### Domain Name and TLS cert

In the current version of `ds-host` you need to use an A-record (and a AAAA too for IPv6) to point a domain and its subdomains to the IP of your VM.

You should also obtain a **wildcard** TLS certificate for this domain. You can do this with [Letsencrypt](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-let-s-encrypt-wildcard-certificates-with-certbot).

<Note>Dropserver makes use of subdomains to keep appspaces and the admin/user sites in different origins.</Note>

### Create Directories

Create an empty data directory, let's say it is `/srv/dropserver`.

Create and empty directory for sockets, say `/var/run/dropserver`.

Make sure the user that will be running `ds-host` has read, write and execute permissions for these directories.

# Configuration File

Create a configuration file such as `/etc/dropserver.json` and make sure the user running `ds-host` can read it.

Read below for configuration examples.

### Behind Reverse Proxy

If you are running `ds-host` behind a reverse proxy listening on ports 80 and 443 with SSL termination (recommended) your config might look something like this:

```json
{
	"data-dir": "/srv/dropserver",
	"server": {
		"port": 5050,
		"host": "example.com",
		"ssl-cert": "",
		"ssl-key": ""
	},
	"port-string":"",
	"subdomains":{
		"user-accounts": "dropid",
		"static-assets": "static"
	},
	"sandbox":{
		"sockets-dir": "/var/run/dropserver",
		"use-cgroups": false
	}
}
```

With the chosen subdomains, you log in at https://dropid.example.com.

<Note>Currently `ds-host` does not serve anything when loading the naked domain (example.com). To log in, visit dropid.example.com (replacing example.com with your domain naturally).</Note>

### Local Network

If you are experimenting on a local network and you are using non-standard ports, you might try a configuration like this one:

```json
{
	"data-dir": "/srv/dropserver",
	"server": {
		"port": 5050,
		"host": "example.com",
		"ssl-cert": "/path/to/ssl/example_com.crt",
		"ssl-key": "/path/to/ssl/example_com.key"
	},
	"port-string":":5050",
	"trust-cert": "/path/to/ssl/rootSSL.pem",
	"subdomains":{
		"user-accounts": "dropid",
		"static-assets": "static"
	},
	"sandbox":{
		"sockets-dir": "/var/run/dropserver",
		"use-cgroups": false
	}
}
```

Notes:
- site will be reachable at https://dropid.example.com:5050 (Set your local DNS server accordingly)
- there would be no reverse proxy in this scenario, and `ds-host` does the SSL termination
- `port-string` is used when generating links in case your installation is reachable on a port other than :80 or :443. In this case it's `:5050`.
- `trust-cert` lets you specify the root SSL cert of your root CA


### No TLS

You can also skip the whole TLS thing for local experimentation like this:

```json
{
	"data-dir": "/srv/dropserver",
	"server": {
		"port": 5050,
		"host": "example.com",
		"ssl-cert": "",
		"ssl-key": ""
	},
	"no-tls": true,
	"port-string":":5050",
	"subdomains":{
		"user-accounts": "dropid",
		"static-assets": "static"
	},
	"sandbox":{
		"sockets-dir": "/var/run/dropserver",
		"use-cgroups": false
	}
}
```

### CGroups

Regardless of the configuration you use from above, you can add cgroup control of sandbox resource usage.

By default `ds-host` uses cgroups (version 2) to measure and control resources used by appspaces (this is a work in progress). 

<Note>To use cgroups, `ds-host` must run in a delegatable cgroup. This is typically accomplished by having systemd run ds-host as a service, and setting `Delegate=true` in the service config (see below).</Note>

The default config for cgroups looks like this:

```json
{
	...
	"sandbox": {
		...
		"use-cgroups": true,
		"cgroup-mount": "/sys/fs/cgroup",
		"memory-high-mb": 512
	}
}
```

- `use-cgroups` set to false if you can not or do not want to deal with cgroups.
- `cgroup-mount`: the location of your system's cgroups.
- `memory-high-mb`: the `memory.high` value for the cgroup that contains all the sandbox cgroups, in megabytes.

## Initial Run

Once you have a configuration file ready, initialize the DB. The `-migrate` flag will migrate the DB to the latest schema, creating a DB in the process if none is found in your data directory.

```
$ ds-host -config=/etc/dropserver.json -migrate
```

Next, create an admin user. Running the `ds-host` command while there is no admin user will automatically prompt for a user then exit:

```
$ ds-host -config=/etc/dropserver.json
```

Finally, you can start `ds-host` directly using the same command again:

```
$ ds-host -config=/etc/dropserver.json
```

## Run with Systemd

In practice it's easier to have systemd run `ds-host`. This is particularly true if you have configured resource limits of appspace sandboxes using cgroups.

Here is a minimal unit file you can use to get started. Replace values as needed and save it as `/etc/systemd/system/dropserver.service`.

```
[Unit]
Description=Dropserver service
ConditionPathExists=/path/to/ds-host
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=dsuser
Group=dsuser
TimeoutStopSec=15

Delegate=true

ExecStart=/path/to/ds-host -config=/etc/dropserver.json

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then you can start the service:

```
$ sudo systemctl start dropserver 
```

Check the service is running with:

```
$ systemctl status dropserver 
```

Tail the logs using:

```
$ journalctl -u dropserver.service -f
```

## Log In

Now that `ds-host` is running log in at the `user-accounts` subdomain specified in your config.

Once logged in, some of the first things to do will be:

- Create a dropid for yourself. A dropid is an id that can be a user of an appspace.
- Add an app by uploading it manually. I recommend you go through the [app tutorial](build-dropserver-app-tutorial) to understand what goes into making apps.
- Create an Appspace by choosing an app and a subdomain.

<Note>The user interface in `ds-host` is unfinished and documentation on how to use it is unwritten. So poke around and ask me questions directly via email or mastodon.</Note>
