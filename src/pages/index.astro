	## An Application Platform for Your Personal Web Services

Dropserver is an open source server for hosting a multitude of small web-based applications.

With Dropserver the goal is not to scale your application to many users, but to allow each user to run their own applications at a small scale. Dropserver is designed to host multiple different applications just for you, your family, your club, or your small business.

... here an image of showing 1 server per small group of people instead of megacorp thing...

You can run your own Dropserver instance for you and your friends, or (hopefully in the future) you will be able to sign up for a commercial host for a few dollars per month.

Once you have a Dropserver, installing an application takes a few clicks and "just works".

		Talk about privacy in a point?, Maybe in first one?
		Talk in such a way that non-tech users don't feel unwelcome ("servers", hardware, are bad?)

	<p>
		Dropserver is a kindred spirit of the "indie web" and "small web" movements, which aims to give internet users the means to control their presence on the web. Dropserver's goal is to give users control over the code they interact with in the cloud.</p>

				Instead of signing up for services that eventually shutdown, degrade, or pivot away, set up a Dropserver and install your own applications.

				Invite friends to your appspaces so you can collaborate, share, and be social. Dropserver Applications can work with just two users, or dozens and hundreds.

			box_title="Convenient Access">
			<Markdown>
				There is no need to create a new login every time you use a new application. Dropserver gives you single-sign-on to all your installed applications.
				
				You also get one-click access to the appspaces your friends have invited you to.

			box_title="Sandboxed Applications">
			<Markdown>
				For your privacy and security each application runs in a sandbox that prevents it from reading files from disk or contacting any server on the internet. If it needs to do any such thing that permission must be explicitly granted by the user.

			box_title="No Lock-In">
			<Markdown>
				Dropserver is open source so you will always be able to run it on your own hardware if you choose to.

				Applications and associated data can be exported and moved to a new home, giving you the freedom to relocate to a new server whenever you feel like it.

			box_title="An Efficient Cloud">
			<Markdown>
				How many apps do you have on your phone? How many do you use regularly? Dropserver is designed with that usage pattern in mind: users should be able to install many applications yet only the actively used ones should consume resources like RAM or CPU cycles.
